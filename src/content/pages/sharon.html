                     is a full-time real estate agent with almost 8 years of experience.

When she accomplishes this, her clients often become friends. For Sharon, that's the ultimate 5-star review. With certifications as a Pricing Strategy Advisor and Commitment to Excellence Endorsed, Sharon is dedicated to making the home-buying and selling process as smooth and enjoyable as possible.
