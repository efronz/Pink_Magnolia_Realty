                        Up to you! We are comfortable with and will most likely use a variation of calls, texts, emails, and in person meetings. At minimum we will communicate about anything pertaining to the house. If we email you something of great importance, we will also text you to let you know it's there. We know how emails can get overlooked. Some examples include: setting up inspections, conveying information about closing, making sure you feel comfortable with the purchase of the property, and being a messenger between every party with a vested interest in the contract.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        To buy a house any buyer would need to: get pre-approved for a loan/make sure they have enough funds to purchase a property in cash (it's more than just the downpayment), find the house/property that will best suit their needs, negotiate the contract through the preferred Realtor®, go under contract, get on the attorney's schedule to close on the contracted date, inspect the property, negotiate any requested repairs, attend closing, and get the deed recorded in the correct county! Easy peasy!

                        North Carolina is an Attorney State instead of a Title State. This means that any property sale must be done through a real estate attorney instead of a title company handling the closing. Attorneys still work closely with title companies in North Carolina to make sure that every title/deed transfer is “free and clear” of any parties that are not immediately involved in the current transaction. The attorney usually recommends the buyer purchase title insurance just in case something shows up after closing that could affect the title.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Earnest Money is a fee (historical evidence suggests a median amount of around 1% of the purchase price that is negotiable within the Offer To Purchase form) paid to the attorney/escrow agent at the beginning of the contract. This fee is held for the seller of the property after the Due Diligence Period has ended as a pseudo “promise to close” while the property is pending. This is deducted from the money a buyer is responsible to bring to closing as a credit for already being paid out and NOT an additional fee on top of the purchase price. Additionally, the Earnest Money Deposit can go back to the buyer if they elect to withdraw from the contract during the Due Diligence Period for any or no reason.

                    <p class="cs-item-p">
                        Similar to the Earnest Money Deposit, the Due Diligence Fee is a fee paid directly from the buyer to the seller. It historically hits at around the 1% range of purchase price offered and is a negotiation point in the Offer. Unlike the Earnest Money Deposit, however, the Due Diligence Fee is almost never refundable to the buyer. In some instances of gross misrepresentation the funds can be released back to the buyer, or the buyer can sue the seller in civil court for the funds back. An example PMR experienced was a seller who had knowingly hidden the evidence of fire damage, a material fact, and the buyer took them to court to gain back the money they paid for Due Diligence and some other incurred fees. In this case the buyer won and the seller had to pay back funds and expenses.

                        I had Sharon to assist us to sell our home. She was wonderful in assisting with open houses and always being willing to talk and assist me with anything that I needed. After the house was sold, we started to look for a new property. We asked for Sharon's assistance with that as well. Before long we made an offer and purchased the next house. I will continue to use Sharon for all of my future realtor needs. She was always thinking about the next step & assisting us with any questions we ever had. I highly recommend her.

                        I was not preparing to buy a house but was able to go through the whole process in 3 weeks from touring to signing. Steven held my hand and worked with me every step of the way. He arranged an extra viewing for my family, helped me find contractors and arranged appointments for minor inspection finds, really went the extra mile for everything. Helped translate house issues post closing and has stopped by since to check progress. I was not ready when I began this journey but I was by the end thanks to Steven.

                        I would have to start off by saying I was not an easy person to deal with. I was on a time crunch to have to find a place and get everything done in less than two months. I want to say Steven knocked it out the park. He made my stress level more of a 4 when it was a 10 plus. Any question I had I always received an answer. He was there for me every step of the way and even after. I recommend him to any one that wants an easy way to get to your perfect home as stress free as possible. An absolute blessing.
