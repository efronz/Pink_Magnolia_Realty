                            Up to you! We are comfortable with and will most likely use a variation of calls, texts, emails, and in person meetings. At minimum we will communicate about anything pertaining to the house. If we email you something of great importance, we will also text you to let you know it's there. We know how emails can get overlooked.   Some examples include: setting up inspections, conveying information about closing, making sure you feel comfortable with the purchase of the property, and being a messenger between every party with a vested interest in the contract.

                            To buy a house any buyer would need to: get pre-approved for a loan/make sure they have enough funds to purchase a property in cash (it's more than just the downpayment), find the house/property that will best suit their needs, negotiate the contract through the preferred Realtor®, go under contract, get on the attorney's schedule to close on the contracted date, inspect the property, negotiate any requested repairs, attend closing, and get the deed recorded in the correct county! Easy peasy!

                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            North Carolina is an Attorney State instead of a Title State. This means that any property sale must be done through a real estate attorney instead of a title company handling the closing. Attorneys still work closely with title companies in North Carolina to make sure that every title/deed transfer is “free and clear” of any parties that are not immediately involved in the current transaction. The attorney usually recommends the buyer purchase title insurance just in case something shows up after closing that could affect the title.

                                What is Earnest Money Deposit?

                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Earnest Money is a fee (historical evidence suggests a median amount of around 1% of the purchase price that is negotiable within the Offer To Purchase form) paid to the attorney/escrow agent at the beginning of the contract. This fee is held for the seller of the property after the Due Diligence Period has ended as a pseudo “promise to close” while the property is pending. This is deducted from the money a buyer is responsible to bring to closing as a credit for already being paid out and NOT an additional fee on top of the purchase price. Additionally, the Earnest Money Deposit can go back to the buyer if they elect to withdraw from the contract during the Due Diligence Period for any or no reason.

                        </button>
                        <p class="cs-item-p">
                            Similar to the Earnest Money Deposit, the Due Diligence Fee is a fee paid directly from the buyer to the seller. It historically hits at around the 1% range of purchase price offered and is a negotiation point in the Offer. Unlike the Earnest Money Deposit, however, the Due Diligence Fee is almost never refundable to the buyer. In some instances of gross misrepresentation the funds can be released back to the buyer, or the buyer can sue the seller in civil court for the funds back. An example PMR experienced was a seller who had knowingly hidden the evidence of fire damage, a material fact, and the buyer took them to court to gain back the money they paid for Due Diligence and some other incurred fees. In this case the buyer won and the seller had to pay back funds and expenses.

                            In short, a Buyer's agent is responsible for walking with the buyer every step of the way on their journey to find a great house or property! From scheduling showings, finding property that meets your specific needs, researching houses that match your secret list of needs that only appears after you start searching for a property, to getting your dream property closed and the deed in your hands!

                            Similar to the duties of a buying agent in North Carolina, the duties of a listing agent are too long to list and <a>can be found in better detail.</a> However, the short of it is a listing agent duties includes: conducting research into the projected fair market value of your property, getting the property professionally measured, getting the property professionally photographed, inputting the property into the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) so it can be dispersed into the third party vendors (Realtor.com, Zillow, etc.), helping you negotiate the contract that will make you happy, monitor all inspections coming in, help negotiate a Due Diligence Repair Request if it comes in, go over the Closing Disclosure with you, and sit through closing to make sure there are no surprises!

                            North Carolina is an “as-is” sale state. That means that the house you put an offer in on is the house you are willing to purchase in its as-is condition. However, most sales in North Carolina also encounter a Due Diligence Request form, which is the form detailing any unknown, unseen details with the property you might want addressed. This request form is another negotiation point for the buyer and the seller to come to an agreeable solution to whatever problems may be there.

                            Material Facts are facts about the property in question that would effect the buyer's interest in the property. Some examples of material facts are: fire damage, structural damages, foundation cracks, known high levels of radon, if drugs were made within the structure, etc. Notably, some common thoughts about houses are not material and would not need to be disclosed such as someone dying within the house or the presence of suspected ghost activity. In short, Material Facts are things a buyer may not automatically see in the structure, but have or had a great impact on the property.

                            <li>"OTP" is the "Offer To Purchase And Contract" standard form 2-T from the North Carloina Realtor and Bar association. It is the main document used during the home buying process for existing residential property. It has some variations for Vacant Land (Form 12-T) and New Construction (Form 800-T), but they all get the job done!</li><br>
                            <li>"DD" is the abbreviation used for "Due Diligence." Due Diligence is the process of doing any and all inspections the buyer may want done to the house to make sure they are getting into a worthwhile investment.</li><br>
                            <li>"EM" is the abbreviation for "Earnest Money Deposit" which is the money paid to an escrow agent at the beginning of a contract to show good faith that the buyer will close on the house after the DD period.</li><br>
                            <li>"MLS" is the abbreviation for the Multiple Listing Service. There are many MLS systems throughout the state of North Carolina, but they all serve the same function. Locally, we subscribe to the Triad MLS to get listing updates in Winston Salem, High Point, Thomasville, Lexington, even up to Surry county! The Charlotte area and western part of the state subscribe to Canopy MLS, and the Triangle area and eastern side of the state subscribe to Triangle MLS.</li><br>
                            <li>"Material Facts" are any facts dealing with the structure of the property that may or may not be immediately visible to a customer or agent. Examples could include fire damage, foundation cracks, high levels of radon and more.</li><br>
                            <li>"CS/Closing Disclosure" is the final form you will see before closing from the attorney. It has all of the monies exchanged within the contract so buyers and sellers know what they will have to bring to the closing table. It will outline lender costs, lawyer costs, county recording costs, taxes and agent compensation where applicable so both parties within the transaction can see exactly where everything falls into place.</li><br>
                            <li>"Closing" is the process of signing all the final paperwork at the attorney's office. This will often consist of a buyer signing all the final loan documents, signing the new deed iinto the buyer's name, signing off on the final CD, and a slew of other legal documents needed by the state and/or county to record the new deed.</li><br>

In homes where there are elevated levels of radon, over 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) on average, it can lead to the development of lung cancer.
